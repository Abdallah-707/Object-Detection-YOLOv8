# Object-Detection-YOLOv8

![Object Detection](ipc-thi-giac-may-tinh.jpg)

## Overview

This repository contains the code for an Object Detection project. Object detection is a computer vision technique that involves locating and classifying objects in images or video. This project aims to implement object detection using [insert technique or framework here, e.g., YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN, etc.].

Below are the main projects and chapters covered in this repository.

## Projects:

### Project 1: Car Counter
- This project focuses on detecting and counting cars in images or video streams.
- Implementation: Using YOLOv8, the system identifies cars in a given image or video and provides a count of the total number of cars detected.

### Project 2: People Counter
- This project involves detecting and counting people in images or video streams.
- Implementation: YOLOv8 is utilized to identify individuals in images or video footage and provides a count of the total number of people detected.

### Project 3: PPE Detection
- This project aims to detect whether individuals are wearing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as helmets, vests, and goggles.
- Implementation: YOLOv8 is employed to identify PPE items in images or video feeds, ensuring safety compliance.

### Project 4: Poker Hand Detector
- This project focuses on identifying and recognizing poker hands in images or video streams.
- Implementation: Utilizing YOLOv8, the system identifies and classifies various poker hands present in an image or video.

## Chapters:

### Chapter 5: Running YOLO
- This chapter provides instructions on how to run the YOLOv8 algorithm for object detection tasks.
- Implementation: Step-by-step guide on installing dependencies, configuring the environment, and executing YOLOv8 for object detection.

### Chapter 6: YOLO with Webcam
- This chapter explains how to utilize YOLOv8 with a webcam for real-time object detection.
- Implementation: Instructions on setting up the webcam, configuring YOLOv8, and running real-time object detection on live video feeds.
